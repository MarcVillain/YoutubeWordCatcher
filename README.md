YoutubeWordCatcher
===

Little script that extracts every clip where a Youtuber says a specific word and builds a big video out of it.

# Install

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Configure

You can edit the configuration by creating a `config.ini` file.

The available sections are:
* **all** : will be loaded in every configuration
* **command** : will be loaded only for the specified command (example: catch)

You can find all the possible values for the configuration in the `__init__()` method of the `ConfigX` classes located at the top of the commands files, which is in the `commands` folder.

# Run

In order to run properly, you need to get a Youtube API key, which you can obtain by following the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application).

```bash
python ywc.py catch --help
```

# Chart

To visualize the data generated by this program, I wrote a command to generate charts.

To use it, make sure you generated the data by running the main program, then execute:

```bash
python ymc.py chart --help
```

You can look at the code to edit some variables if necessary, or add your own data visualization.

# TODO

* Multithread the data extraction
* Manual clip sorter to remove false positives
* Improve timestamps with SpeechRecognition plugin
