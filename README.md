YoutubeWordCatcher
===

Little script that extracts every clip where a Youtuber says a specific word and builds a big video out of it.

# Install

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run

In order to run properly, you need to get a Youtube API key, which you can obtain by following the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application).

You can edit the configuration in the `config.py` file.

```bash
python ./run.py
```

# Chart

To visualize the data generated by this program, I wrote a little script to generate a chart. It represents the relative usage of the matched word. The higher the value, the more the word was pronounced in a shorter time.

To use it, make sure you generated the data by running the main program, then execute:

```bash
python gen_chart.py
```

You can look at the code to edit some variables if necessary.

# TODO

* Multithread the data extraction
* Manual clip sorter to remove false positives
